<h1 align="start"> Automatic chemical treatment system for pools </h1>


The lines of the presented code were developed to control an automatic chemical treatment system for pool water. The project's functionality aimed to enable the user to initially configure the characteristics of his pool (volume and dosage of products used) and later the system conducts the monitoring and application of chemical products automatically.

The system was built with the following components: actuators, sensors, HMI and a microcontroller, according to the flowchart below.
